# washing_machine_pic_controller
Designed and implemented a modular washing machine controller using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The system simulates real-world appliance control through a finite state machine (FSM) architecture, handling wash, rinse, and spin cycles with precise timing and safety logic. Simulation was performed using PICSim, (PIC microcontroller simulator.)
